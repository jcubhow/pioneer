          <p class="lead">The Purdue Memorial Union was inaugurated in 1924 as a tribute to Purdue students who participated and lost their lives in World War I. The building's funding began with the Class of 1912 and was further fueled by the war's impact on the Purdue community. Originally conceived as a student union, it was designed to serve as a central gathering place for students, staff, and visitors, enhancing community interaction and memorializing fallen soldiers.</p>
